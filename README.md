## Introduction

Online dictionary learning is a crucial aspect of signal processing and machine learning, where dictionaries are adaptively updated as new data becomes available. This project focuses on a bilevel optimization approach, as proposed in the paper by Jiang et al., to efficiently address the online dictionary learning problem.

## Features

- Implementation of the bilevel optimization algorithm for online dictionary learning.
- Comparison with other algorithms such as Frank-Wolfe.
- Analysis of convergence and reconstruction error over iterations.
- Visualization of results and performance metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MahirSelek/online-dictionary-bilevel.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
